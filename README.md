## All-gender restroom sign

![All-gender restroom sign](all-gender-toilets.png)

Our all-gender restroom sign was adapted from the public domain
[unisex public toilet sign][unisex-sign].
It's meant to represent people of ALL genders: Women, men and everyone else who
doesn't fall into any of these categories.

We also put signs with a text adapted from [@LGBTplusBristol's tweet][tweet1]
at the walls in/near the restrooms.
(See [this tweet by a visitor][tweet2] for reference.)
If your venue has any binary-gendered toilets (men's/women's), we highly
recommend adopting these signs as well.

An alternative solution for the "confusing" gender neutral toilet sign issue
was suggested [at "it's pronounced metrosexual" blog][blog].
While we did not use the proposed sign due to unclear licensing conditions, it
served as an inspiration.
